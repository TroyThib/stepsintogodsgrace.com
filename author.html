<p>
  Lynn Hoffmann was born and raised in rural Rhode Island and later moved to southern Florida.  She ultimately graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a degree in accounting. She raised three children and founded a regional commercial real estate company in which she served as the President.
</p>
<p>
After a failed first marriage, God called Lynn into a deep personal relationship with Jesus. As Lynn grew spiritually, she continued to struggle with the realities of life that were brought on with work, a new husband and blending a family.
</p> 

<p>During these struggles, God graciously led Lynn into a 12 Step recovery group that provided a foundation for her personal healing and transformation.  
Lynn mentors women, teaches bible studies and loves to read and be by the water. She and her husband of 19 years live in Dallas, Texas.</p>
